PHP/MySQL Blogging engine with enough security that you can use it on a library computer without HTTPS and not be worried about someone compromising your account. 

The goal is to have strong authenticity, not privacy. Most of the articles I write end up being published, and I am not trying to keep drafts secret. Text of articles are sent in the clear if not used with HTTPS. 

Passwords are never sent in the clear.  

This is a work in progress, but functional enough that I use it myself.
